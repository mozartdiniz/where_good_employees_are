1. In order to use the same bubble colors, we will need:

- seven country numbers [-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3]
- for each location, we will thus need to use one of these numbers to indicate the country
- these numbers are generated by a function that takes as input the key "change" in the following way:
    - a change < -0.25, generates -3
    - a change < -0.05 generates -2
    - a change <= -0.001 generates -1
    - a change <= 0.05 generates 0
    - a change <= 0.25 generates 2
    - anything bigger than that generates 3
