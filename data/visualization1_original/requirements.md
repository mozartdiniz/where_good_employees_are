1. In order to use the same bubble colors, we will need:

- seven country numbers [-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3]
- for each location, we will thus need to use one of these numbers to indicate the country
- these numbers are generated by a function that takes as input the key "change" in the following way:
    - a change < -0.25, generates -3
    - a change < -0.05 generates -2
    - a change <= -0.001 generates -1
    - a change <= 0.05 generates 0
    - a change <= 0.25 generates 2
    - anything bigger than that generates 3


2. In order to use (more or less) the same bubble radius, we will need:

- to use the average employment duration value for the key "budget_2012"

Example:
{
    "name": "Hilversum",
    "positions": {
      "total": {
        "x": 553,
        "y": 318
      },
      "department": {
        "x": 446,
        "y": 262
      }
    },
    "id": 261,
    "budget_2012": 9,
    "change": 0.25, // this will generated a certain colour related to the Netherlands
    "budget_2013": 9, // average employment duration 9 years
    "department": "Netherlands",
    "discretion": "Mandatory" //can be Mandatory or Discretionary, I will convert them to senior/junior
  },
